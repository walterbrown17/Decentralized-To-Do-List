# Decentralized To-Do List

## Project Description

A decentralized to-do list built on the Core Blockchain using Solidity. This dApp allows users to manage their daily tasks directly on the blockchain, giving them full control and transparency without relying on centralized services.

## Project Vision

The vision is to create a censorship-resistant and user-owned task management system. In a world increasingly aware of data ownership, this decentralized to-do list empowers users to maintain personal productivity records on-chain with complete privacy and autonomy.

## Key Features

- Add new tasks with descriptions.
- Retrieve all tasks created by a user.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Delete tasks when no longer needed.
- All data is stored on-chain per user account.

## Future Scope

- Add timestamps and priority levels to tasks.
- Enable task sharing between users.
- Integrate with front-end frameworks like React or Next.js.
- Add reminder/notification system through off-chain oracles.
